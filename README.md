Design Report: For this assignment, I want to familiarize myself more with Bootstrap and its styling mechanisms, so I plan to really delve into how to use Bootstrap for styling purposes. As such, a lot of my styling for this site revolves around the Bootstrap theme, specifically its dark theme. I thought that the dark theme was fitting both for space and the darkness of the night sky, as well as a nice contrast to the images in the APOD. It was important for me to include a description giving credit to the creators of the APOD as credit is a critical part of being an artist and programmer. I added a few pops of colour to user buttons in blue, as well as the star button turning a gold colour on click. Overall, my site focuses on function, and usability, and how that relates to Bootstrap.
